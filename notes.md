# My notes
#
# git commands:
# git mv file1 file 2 --------- how to rename file
# git checkout ---------- how to go back to previous version if something goes wrong
# git status ----------- shows what things need to be committed
# git rm ------------ removes file and lets git know
#
# push and pull are mainly when working collaboratively in groups
#
# instead of concatenating a string with +, use a stringbuilder
# StringBuilder builder = newStringBuilder();
# builder.append("googoo");
# String str = builder.toString();
#
#
